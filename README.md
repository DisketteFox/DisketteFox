Hi! My name is Miles, also known as **DisketteFox**, and I am a little developer learning markup and programming languages.
In this page you might see my school projects and my attempts at my own projects.

## ðŸª´ â€” About me â€”  ðŸª´

Ever since I was a little kid I was fascinated with computers, programs, intenet, so I decided to dig myself into this little world that programming is.
I started with Scratch for 5 years, which molded my mind to understand programming structures, helping me to start programming.
My first real programming language was Python, alongside with programming Arduino algorythms.
Then, I touched a little bit of lua and json whilst modifying some videogames I liked at that time.
Now I'm mainly studying Java at my school and, at the same time, Im studying HTML and CSS by myself.

## ðŸ“œ â€” Languages I know â€”  ðŸ“œ
