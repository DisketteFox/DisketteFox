# Welcome to my profile ðŸ˜¸

Hi! My name is Miles, also known as **DisketteFox**, and I am a little developer learning markup and programming languages.
In this page you might see my school projects and my attempts at my own projects.

## ðŸª´ â€” About me â€”  ðŸª´

Ever since I was a little kid I was fascinated with computers, programs, intenet, so I decided to dig myself into this little world that programming is.
I started with Scratch for 5 years, which molded my mind to understand programming structures, helping me to start programming.
My first real programming language was Python, alongside with programming Arduino algorythms.
Then, I touched a little bit of lua and json whilst modifying some videogames I liked at that time.
Now I'm mainly studying Java at my school and, at the same time, Im studying HTML and CSS by myself.

And that's all for now. See ya! ðŸ˜º
